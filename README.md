Slack is like IRC. I have a Slack #no_framework_php channel. Let me know if you would like an invitation to join my team on Slack.

Sam is leading this PHP project while growing his coding skills.
He is learning from Lynda.com courses.

Without using a PHP framework Sam will have a project for BusCompanyX.com
This is an Open Source project and Sam is looking for collaborators
who do pull requests.

The no_framework PHP code will be general enough that it can be
used for any project. Having said that I also say:
Possible end users of this code are school bus contractors.
Since this is free and open source
software revenue is derived by those who implement
it for school bus contractors.

Thanks for reading.
