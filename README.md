# no_framework
Without using a PHP framework I will have a project for BusCompanyX.com 

Sam is creating this project while growing his coding skills.
He is learning from Lynda.com courses.

This is an Open Source project and Sam is looking for a contributor.

The end user of the code is school bus contractors
in the English speaking world.

Since this is free and open source
software revenue is derived by those who implement
it for school bus contractors.

You know how WordPress has two versions. There is the one
which users use for free and is hosted on wordpress.com,
and another which users can download and install themselves.
Well this project will be kind of the same way. There is a copy
which Sam will run on the server at https://BusCompanyX.com
However, others can run this project on their own server
and domain.

Sameh R. Labib is the brains of this project. If you choose to
partner up with him then you'll need to do things his way. You can make suggestions
now and then. But you will follow his lead.

Thanks for reading.
