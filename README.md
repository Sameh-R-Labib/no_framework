Sam is leading this project while growing his coding skills.
He is learning from Lynda.com courses.

Without using a PHP framework Sam will have a project for BusCompanyX.com

This is an Open Source project and Sam is looking for a collaborators
who would send him GitHub pull requests.

Possible end users of this code are school bus contractors
in the English speaking world.

Since this is free and open source
software revenue is derived by those who implement
it for school bus contractors.

Thanks for reading.
